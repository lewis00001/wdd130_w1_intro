    <h1>About Me: Lewis Lockhart</h1>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        My early life is hard to explain but I will give it a try. My conception was part of a program 
        called Project Mendacium and was a remnant of the Carter Administration allowed to continue when 
        President Reagan took office. I was one of nearly 700 original attempts to create human life 
        within a laboratory womb (called Mother Genesis). Just my sister Ocean and I were successful. I 
        struggle with the idea of genealogy work since I have none to speak of.

    <h3>
        Education / Career
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have only been 'out in the real world' for 15 years now. I have been allowed to attend college but am 
        required to get two separate degrees. The first one was to be a MFA in conceptual art and the second is 
        required to be in a technical field such as software engineering, which is what I study now. Currently I 
        work software test engineer at Simplifile which is a company that works with banks, title companies, and 
        county offices to streamline the mortgage process. We are located by the Provo Riverwoods. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Hobbies
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have interest and proficiency in the following areas: history, mechanical design, music, cooking, motion 
        graphics, drawing, writing (short stories / comedy), management, programming, business analytics and accounting.
